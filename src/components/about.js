        About Us
      </h2>
      <p> 
      Lions & Trees is a family-run enterprise that provides high-touch personal financial advice 
      to its clients at industry-low costs. Named after the currency in Narnia*, mentioned during 
      Prince Caspian's epic adventure to the edge of the Eastern Ocean, our company endeavors to 
      multiply our clients' "Lions" & "Trees" -- that is, improve their financial health. We do 
      this by analyzing everything from small to big -- from the day-to-day decision-making to 
      the long-term stewardship of assets -- as we guide clients in the direction of their specific
     financial objectives.

      Lions & Trees features the family team of dad Pete and twin teenagers John and Eden. Pete has
       worked in finance for more than a decade and has developed a deep reservoir of personal 
       finance expertise and experience. John and Eden handle the business's back end, including
        brand management, web development, bookkeeping, and even some research.

       'Lions' and 'Trees' such as you might see any day in the marketplace of Beaversdam or Beruna."
